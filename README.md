                                    Simple Login and Registration Form

This project is a straightforward Welcome Page containing two forms: a Login form for existing users and a Registration form for new users. The entire layout is created using three essential web technologies: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

What's Inside?

1. Technology Basics
JavaScript: This makes the forms interactive, allowing you to switch between Login and Registration smoothly.
HTML: This is the backbone, defining the structure of the webpage and the forms.
CSS: Styling is done here, making the page look good and responsive.

2. Key Features
Navigation Bar: You have a fixed bar at the top with links to different sections.
Login and Registration Forms: There are two boxes for logging in and registering. You choose what you want to do.
Form Styling: The forms are designed to be user-friendly, with clear input boxes and icons.
Remember Me and Forgot Password: The login form has options like "Remember Me" and a link for "Forgot Password."
Checkbox and Terms & Conditions: The registration form has a checkbox for accepting terms and conditions.
Responsive Design: It looks good on any device - your computer, tablet, or phone.

3. Style Points
Header Design: A nice header at the top with a logo and easy-to-find links.
Background Image: The background has a cool image, making things more interesting.
Container Design: The main content area has a see-through effect, making it look modern.
Button Styles: Buttons are designed to look good and change a bit when you hover over them.

4. How It Works (In Simple Terms)
You click on the links to go to different parts of the website.
If you already have an account, click "Login" and fill in your email and password.
If you're new, click "Register" and create a username, email, and password.
There's a checkbox if you agree to some terms during registration.
The webpage looks nice on all devices, and buttons do cool stuff when you click or hover over them.

5. How to Try It Out
Copy the code into a file.
Open it with your web browser.
You'll see a page where you can either log in or register.
